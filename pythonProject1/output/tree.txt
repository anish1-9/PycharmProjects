A tree is a tall, perennial plant with a single stem or trunk and numerous branches, leaves, and roots. These plants can grow up to several hundred feet, depending on the species. Trees provide various benefits to the environment, including oxygen production, carbon sequestration, and habitat for animals. They also have cultural and aesthetic importance, often symbolizing strength, stability, and longevity. Trees are found in many different ecosystems, including forests, deserts, and even the arctic tundra.
