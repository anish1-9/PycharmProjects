Area refers to the measurement of the extent of a two-dimensional region or a surface within a closed boundary. It is typically expressed in square units, such as square meters, square feet, or square kilometers, and is used to quantify the amount of space that an object occupies. The calculation of an area is dependent on the shape and dimensions of the object or surface being measured, and various formulas and techniques are used to determine the area.
