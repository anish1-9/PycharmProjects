The theory of probabilities is simply the Science of logic
quantitatively treated. – C.S. PEIRCE  
13.1  Introduction
In earlier Classes, we have studied the probability as a
measure of uncertainty of events in a random experiment.
We discussed the axiomatic approach formulated by
Russian Mathematician, A.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987)
and treated probability as a function of outcomes of theexperiment. We have also established equivalence betweenthe axiomatic theory and the classical theory of probabilityin case of equally likely outcomes. On the basis of this
relationship, we obtained probabilities of events associatedwith discrete sample spaces. We have also studied theaddition rule of probability. In this chapter, we shall discussthe important concept of conditional probability of an eventgiven that another event has occurred, which will be helpfulin understanding the Bayes' theorem, multiplication rule ofprobability and independence of events. We shall also learnan  important concept of  random variable and its probability
distribution and also the mean and variance of a probability  distribution. In the lastsection of the chapter, we shall study an important discrete probability distributioncalled  Binomial distribution. Throughout this chapter, we shall take up the experimentshaving equally likely outcomes, unless stated otherwise.
13.2  Conditional Probability
Uptill now in probability, we have discussed the methods of finding the probability of
events. If we have two events from the same sample space, does the informationabout the occurrence of one of the events affect the probability of the other event? Let
us try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes
are equally likely to occur.
Consider the experiment of tossing three fair coins. The sample space of the
experiment is
S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}Chapter 13

If at least one of the above is not true for three given events, we say that the
events are not independent.
Example 10  A die is thrown. If E is the event ‘the number appearing is a multiple of
3’ and F be the event ‘the number appearing is even’ then find whether E and F are
independent ?
Solution  We know that the sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Now E = { 3, 6}, F = { 2, 4, 6} and  E ∩ F = {6}
Then P(E) = 21 31 1,P ( F ) a n dP ( E  F )63 62 6=== ∩ =
Clearly P (E ∩ F) = P(E). P (F)
Hence E and F are independent events.
Example 11  An unbiased die is thrown twice. Let the event A be ‘odd number on the
first throw’ and B the event ‘odd number on the second throw’. Check the independenceof the events A and B.
Solution  If all the 36 elementary events of the experiment are considered to be equally
likely, we have
P(A) =18 1
36 2= and 18 1P(B )36 2  
Also P (A ∩ B) = P (odd number on both throws)
=91
36 4=
Now P(A) P(B) =111
224×=
Clearly P (A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
Thus, A and B are independent events
Example 12  Three coins are tossed simultaneously. Consider the event E ‘three heads
or three tails’, F ‘at least two heads’ and G ‘at most two heads’. Of the pairs (E,F),
(E,G) and (F,G), which are independent? which are dependent?
Solution  The sample space of the experiment is given by
S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
Clearly E = {HHH, TTT}, F= {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}

PROBABILITY      533
Thus, we can also write the conditional probability of E given that F has occurred as
P(E|F) =Number of elementaryeventsfavourable to E F
Number of elementaryevents which arefavourable to F∩
=(E F)
(F)n
n∩
Dividing the numerator and the denominator by total number of elementary events
of the sample space, we see that P(E|F) can also be written as
P(E|F) =(E F)
P(E F) (S)
(F) P(F)
(S)n
n
n
n∩
∩= ... (1)
Note that (1) is valid only when P(F) ≠ 0 i.e., F ≠ φ (Why?)
Thus, we can define the conditional probability as follows :
Definition 1  If  E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a
random experiment, the conditional probability of the event E given that F has occurred,
i.e. P (E|F) is given by
P(E|F) =P(E F)
P(F)∩ provided P(F) ≠ 0
13.2.1   Properties of conditional probability
Let E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have
Property 1  P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1
We know that
P(S|F) =P(S F) P(F)1P(F) P(F)∩==
Also P(F|F) =P(F F ) P(F )1P(F) P(F )∩==
Thus P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1
Property 2  If A and B are any two events of a sample space S and F is an event
of S such that P(F) ≠ 0, then
P((A  ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A ∩ B)|F)

 538 MATHEMA TICS
Let F be the event that ‘there is at least one tail ’ and E be the event ‘the die shows
a number greater than 4 ’. Then
F = {(H,T), (T,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T,6)}
E = {(T,5), (T,6)} and E ∩ F = {(T,5), (T,6)}
Now P(F) = P({(H,T)}) + P ({(T,1)}) + P ({(T,2)}) + P ({(T,3)})
+ P ({(T,4)}) + P({(T,5)}) + P({(T,6)})

13.5  Bayes' Theorem
Consider that there are two bags I and II. Bag I contains 2 white and 3 red balls andBag II contains 4 white and 5 red balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the
bags. We can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e. 1
2) or probability of
drawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I). In
other words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour, if
we are given the bag from which the ball is drawn. But, can we find the probability that
the ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is
given? Here, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an
event occurred after it is known. Famous mathematician, John Bayes' solved the problemof finding reverse probability by using conditional probability. The formula developed
by him is known as ‘Bayes theorem’ which was published posthumously in 1763.
Before stating and proving the Bayes' theorem, let us first take up a definition and
some preliminary results.
13.5.1  Partition of a sample space
A set of events E1, E2, ..., En is said to represent a partition of the sample space S if
(a) Ei ∩ Ej = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, ...,  n


PROBABILITY      535
Solution  Let b stand for boy and g for girl. The sample space of the experiment is
S = {( b, b), (g, b), (b, g), (g, g)}
Let E and F denote the following events :
E : ‘both the children are boys’
F : ‘at least one of the child is a boy’Then E = {( b,b)} and F = {( b,b), (g,b), (b,g)}
Now E  ∩ F = {( b,b)}
Thus P (F) =3
4 and P (E ∩ F )= 1

Therefore P (E|F) =1
P(E F ) 1 4

Example 3   Ten cards  numbered 1 to 10 are placed in a box, mixed up thoroughly and
then one card is drawn randomly. If it is known that the number on the drawn card is
more than 3, what is the probability that it is an even number?
Solution  Let A be the event ‘the number on the card drawn is even’ and B be the
event ‘the number on the card drawn is  greater than 3’. We have to find P(A|B).
Now, the sample space of the experiment is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Then A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10},  B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
and A ∩ B = {4, 6, 8, 10}
Also P(A) =57 4,P ( B )= a n dP ( A B )10 10 10∩=

Example 4  In a school, there are 1000 students, out of which 430 are girls. It is known
that out of 430, 10% of the girls study in class XII. What is the probability that a student
chosen randomly studies in Class XII given that the chosen student is a girl?
Solution  Let E denote the event that a student chosen randomly studies in Class XII
and F be the event that the randomly chosen student is a girl. We have to find P (E|F).


PROBABILITY      541
Now P(E) = P (black ball in first draw) = 10
15
Also given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there
are 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn. Therefore, the probability that the
second ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but
the conditional probability of F given that E has occurred.
i.e. P(F|E) =9
14
By multiplication rule of probability, we have
P (E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E)
=10 9 3
15 14 7 
Multiplication rule of probability for more than two events If E, F and G are
three events of sample space, we have
P(E ∩ F ∩ G) = P(E) P(F|E) P(G|(E ∩ F)) = P(E) P(F|E) P(G|EF)
Similarly, the multiplication rule of probability can be extended for four or
more events.
The following example illustrates the extension of multiplication rule of probability
for three events.
Example 9  Three cards are drawn successively, without replacement from a pack of
52 well shuffled cards. What is the probability that first two cards are kings and the
third card drawn is an ace?
Solution  Let K denote the event that the card drawn is king and A be the event that
the card drawn is an ace. Clearly, we have to find P (KKA)
Now P(K) =4
52
Also, P (K|K) is the probability of second king with the condition that one king has
already been drawn. Now there are three kings in (52  − 1) = 51 cards.
Therefore P(K|K) =3
51
Lastly, P(A|KK) is the probability of third drawn card to be an ace, with the condition
that two kings have already been drawn. Now there are four aces in left 50 cards.

Example 15  A person has undertaken a construction job. The probabilities are 0.65
that there will be strike, 0.80 that the construction job will be completed on time if there
is no strike, and 0.32 that the construction job will be completed on time if there is astrike. Determine the probability that the construction job will be completed on time.
Solution  Let A be the event that the construction job will be completed on time, and B
be the event that there will be a strike. We have to find P(A).We have
P(B) = 0.65, P(no strike) = P(B ′) = 1 
− P(B) = 1 − 0.65 = 0.35
P(A|B) = 0.32, P(A|B ′) = 0.80
Since events B and B ′ form a partition of the sample space S, therefore, by theorem
on total probability, we have
P(A) = P(B) P(A|B) + P(B ′) P(A|B ′)
         = 0.65 × 0.32 + 0.35 × 0.8

Then X (HHH) = Rs (2 × 3) = Rs 6
X(HHT) = X (HTH) = X(THH) = Rs (2 × 2 − 1 × 1.50) = Rs 2.50
X(HTT) = X(THT) = (TTH) = Rs (1 × 2) – (2 × 1.50) = – Re 1
and X (TTT) = − Rs (3 × 1.50) =  − Rs 4.50
where, minus sign shows the loss to the player. Thus, for each element of the sample
space, X takes a unique value, hence, X is a function on the sample space whose rangeis
{–1,  2.50,  – 4.50,  6}
Example 23   A  bag contains 2 white and 1 red balls. One ball is drawn at random and
then put back in the box after noting its colour. The process is repeated again.  If X
denotes the number of red balls recorded in the two draws, describe X.
Solution  Let the balls in the bag be denoted by w1, w2, r. Then the sample space is
S = { w1 w1, w1 w2, w2 w2, w2 w1, w1 r, w2 r, r w1, r w2, r r}
Now, for ω ∈ S
X(ω) = number of red balls
Therefore
X({w1 w1}) = X({ w1 w2}) = X({ w2 w2}) = X({ w2 w1}) = 0
X({w1 r}) = X({ w2 r}) = X({ r w1}) = X({ r w2}) = 1 and X({ r r}) = 2
Thus, X is a random variable which can take values 0,  1 or 2.
13.6.1  Probability distribution of a random variable
Let us  look at the experiment of selecting one family out of ten families f1,  f2 ,..., f10 in
such a manner that each family  is equally likely to be selected. Let the families f1,  f2,
... , f10  have 3, 4, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 4, 5 members, respectively.
Let us select a family and note down the number of members in the family denoting
X. Clearly, X is a random variable defined as below :
X(f1) = 3, X( f2) = 4, X( f3) = 3, X( f4) = 2, X( f5) = 5,
X(f6) = 4, X( f7) = 3, X( f8) = 6, X( f9) = 4, X( f10) = 5
Thus, X can take any value 2,3,4,5 or 6 depending upon which family is selected.
Now,  X will take the value 2 when the family f4 is selected.  X can take the value
3 when any one of the families f1, f3, f7 is selected.
Similarly, X = 4,  when family f2, f6 or f9 is selected,
X = 5,  when family f5 or f10 is selected
and X = 6, when family f8  is selected.

 560 MATHEMA TICS
Since we had assumed that each family is equally likely to be selected, the probability
that family f4 is selected is 1
10.
Thus, the probability that X can take the value 2 is 1
10. We write P(X = 2) =1
10
Also, the probability that any one of the families f1, f3 or f7 is selected is
P({f1, f3, f7}) =3
10
Thus, the probability that X can take the value 3 = 3
10
We write P(X = 3) =3
10
Similarly, we obtain
P(X = 4) = P({ f2, f6, f9}) =3
10
P(X = 5) = P({ f5, f10}) =2
10
and P(X = 6) = P({ f8}) =1
10
Such a description giving the values of the random variable along with the
corresponding probabilities is called the probability distribution of the random
variable X .
In general, the probability distribution of a random variable X is defined as follows:
Definition 5  The probability distribution of a random variable X is the system of numbers
X: x1x2... xn
P(X) : p1p2... pn
where,
10,n
ii
ip p
   = 1, i = 1, 2,..., n
The real numbers x1, x2,..., xn are the possible values of the random variable X and
pi (i = 1,2,...,  n) is the probability of the random variable X taking the value xi i.e.,
P(X = xi) = pi


PROBABILITY      561
$Note   If xi is one of the possible values of a random variable X, the statement
X = xi is true only at some point (s) of the sample space. Hence, the probability that
X takes value xi is always nonzero, i.e. P(X =  xi) ≠ 0.
Also for all possible values of the random variable X, all elements of the sample
space are covered. Hence, the sum of all the probabilities in a probability distribution
must be one.
Example 24  Two cards are drawn successively with replacement from a well-shuffled
deck of 52 cards. Find the probability distribution of the number of aces.
Solution  The number of aces is a random variable. Let it be denoted by X. Clearly, X
can take the values 0, 1, or 2.
Now, since the draws are done with replacement, therefore, the two draws form
independent experiments.
Therefore, P(X = 0) = P(non-ace and non-ace)
= P(non-ace) × P(non-ace)
=48 48 144

P(X = 1) = P(ace and non-ace or non-ace and ace)

ixp
=∑ i.e. the mean of X is the weighted average of the possible values of X,
each value being weighted by its probability with which it occurs.
The mean of a random variable X is also called the expectation of X, denoted by
E(X).
Thus, E (X) = μ =
1n
ii
ixp
  = x1 p1+ x2 p2 + ... + xn pn.
In other words, the mean or expectation of a random variable X is the sum of the
products of all possible values of X by their respective probabilities.
Example 27  Let a pair of dice be thrown and the random variable X be the sum of the
numbers that appear on the two dice. Find the mean or expectation of X.
Solution  The sample space of the experiment consists of 36 elementary events in the
form of ordered pairs ( xi, yi), where xi = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and yi = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
The random variable X i.e. the sum of the numbers on the two dice takes the
values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12.
Now P(X = 2) = P({(1,1)}) 1

13.6.2  Mean of a random variable
In many problems, it is desirable to describe some feature of the random variable by
means of a single number that can be computed from its probability distribution. Fewsuch numbers are mean, median and mode. In this section, we shall discuss mean only.
Mean is a measure of location or central tendency in the sense that it roughly locates a
middle  or average value of the random variable.

13.4  Independent Events
Consider the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of 52 playing cards, in which
the elementary events are assumed to be equally likely. If E and F denote the events'the card drawn is a spade' and 'the card drawn is an ace' respectively, then
P(E) =13 1 4 1and P(F)52 4 52 13   
Also E and F is the event ' the card drawn is the ace of spades' so that
P(E∩F) =1
52
Hence P(E|F) =1
P(E F ) 1 52
1 P(F ) 4
13   
Since P(E) = 1
4= P (E|F), we can say that the occurrence of event F has not
affected the probability of occurrence of the event E.
We also have
P(F|E) =1
P(E F ) 1 52P(F)1 P(E) 13
4    
Again,  P(F) = 1
13 = P(F|E) shows that occurrence of event E has not affected
the probability of occurrence of the event F.
Thus, E and F are two events such that the probability of occurrence of one of
them is not affected by occurrence of the other.
Such events are called independent events .

13.6.3  Variance of a random variable
The mean of a random variable does not give us information about the variability in the
values of the random variable. In fact, if the variance is small, then the values of therandom variable are close to the mean. Also random variables with different probability
distributions can have equal means, as shown in the following distributions of X and Y .

Solution  Let E denote the event that the person selected is actually having HIV and A
the event that the person's HIV test is diagnosed as +ive. We need to find P(E|A).
Also E ′ denotes the event that the person selected is actually not having HIV .

13.7.2   Binomial distribution
Consider the experiment of tossing a coin in which each trial results in success (say,
heads) or failure (tails). Let S and F denote respectively success and failure in eachtrial. Suppose we are interested in finding the ways in which we have one success in
six trials.
Clearly, six different cases are there as listed below:
SFFFFF,  FSFFFF, FFSFFF, FFFSFF, FFFFSF,  FFFFFS.
Similarly, two successes and four failures can have 6!
4! 2! combinations. It will be
lengthy job to list all of these ways. Therefore, calculation of probabilities of 0, 1, 2,...,
n number of successes may be lengthy and time consuming. To avoid the lengthy
calculations and listing of all the possible cases, for the probabilities  of number of
successes in n-Bernoulli trials, a formula is derived. For this purpose, let us take the
experiment made up of three Bernoulli trials with probabilities p and q = 1 – p for
success and failure respectively in each trial. The sample space of the experiment is
the set
S = {SSS, SSF, SFS, FSS, SFF, FSF, FFS, FFF}
The number of successes is a random variable X and can take values 0, 1, 2, or 3.
The probability distribution of the number of successes is as below :
P(X = 0) = P(no success)
= P({FFF}) = P(F) P(F) P(F)
=q . q . q = q3 since   the trials are independent
P(X = 1) = P(one successes)
= P({SFF, FSF, FFS})= P({SFF}) + P({FSF}) + P({FFS})
= P(S) P(F) P(F) + P(F) P(S) P(F) + P(F) P(F) P(S)=p.q.q + q.p.q  + q.q.p  = 3pq

13.7  Bernoulli Trials and Binomial Distribution
13.7.1  Bernoulli trials
Many experiments are dichotomous in nature. For example, a tossed coin shows a
‘head’ or ‘tail’, a manufactured item can be ‘defective’ or ‘non-defective’, the response
to a question might be ‘yes’ or ‘no’, an egg has ‘hatched’ or ‘not hatched’, the decision
is ‘yes’ or ‘no’ etc. In such cases, it is customary to call one of the outcomes a ‘success’
and the other ‘not success’ or ‘failure’. For example, in tossing a coin, if the occurrenceof the head is considered a success, then occurrence of tail is a failure.
Each time we toss a coin or roll a die or perform any other experiment, we call it a
trial. If a coin is tossed, say, 4 times, the number of trials is 4, each having exactly two
outcomes, namely, success or failure. The outcome of any trial is independent of theoutcome of any other trial. In each of such trials, the probability of success or failureremains constant. Such independent trials which have only two outcomes usuallyreferred as ‘success’ or ‘failure’ are called Bernoulli trials .
Definition 8  Trials of a random experiment are called Bernoulli trials, if they satisfy
the following conditions :
(i) There should be a finite number of trials.
(ii) The trials should be independent.
(iii) Each trial has exactly two outcomes : success or failure.
(iv) The probability of  success remains the same in each trial.
For example, throwing a die 50 times is a case of 50 Bernoulli trials, in which each
trial results in success (say an even number) or failure (an odd number) and theprobability of success ( p) is same for all 50 throws. Obviously, the successive throws
of the die are independent experiments. If the die is fair and have six numbers 1 to 6
written on six faces, then  p = 1
2 and q = 1 – p = 1
2 = probability of failure.
Example 30  Six balls are drawn successively from an urn containing 7 red and 9 black
balls. Tell whether or not the trials of drawing balls are Bernoulli trials when after each
draw the ball drawn is
(i) replaced (ii) not replaced in the urn.
Solution
(i) The number of trials is finite. When the drawing is done with replacement, the
probability of success (say, red ball) is  p = 7
16 which is same for all six trials
(draws). Hence, the drawing of balls with replacements are Bernoulli trials.

4. How many minimum
number of times must he/she fire so that the probability of hitting the target at least
once is more than 0.99?
Solution  Let the shooter fire n times. Obviously, n fires are n Bernoulli trials. In each
trial, p = probability of hitting the target = 3

Example 32  Ten eggs are drawn successively with replacement from a lot containing
10% defective eggs. Find the probability that there is at least one defective egg.
Solution  Let X denote the number of defective eggs in the 10 eggs drawn. Since the
drawing is done with replacement, the trials are Bernoulli trials. Clearly, X has the
binomial distribution with n = 10 and 10 1

Therefore q =9110p−=

Example 36  A and B throw a die alternatively  till one of them gets a ‘6’ and wins the
game. Find their respective probabilities of winning, if A starts first.
Solution  Let S denote the success (getting a ‘6’) and F denote the failure (not getting

Thus, P(S) =15,P ( F )66=

Example 37  If a machine is correctly set up, it produces 90% acceptable items. If it is
incorrectly set up, it produces only 40% acceptable items. Past experience shows that
80% of the set ups are correctly done. If after a certain set up, the machine produces
2 acceptable items, find the probability that the machine is correctly setup.
Solution  Let A be the event that the machine produces 2 acceptable items.
Also let B1 represent the event of correct set up and B2 represent the event of
incorrect setup.
Now P(B1) = 0.8, P(B2) = 0.2
P(A|B1) = 0.9 × 0.9  and P(A|B2) =  0.4 × 0.4

 Historical Note
The earliest indication on measurement of chances in game of dice appeared
in 1477 in a commentary on Dante's Divine Comedy. A treatise on gambling
named liber de Ludo Alcae , by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published
posthumously in 1663. In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases
for each event when two dice are thrown.

To distinguish X from Y , we require a measure of the extent to which the values of
the random variables spread out. In Statistics, we have studied that the variance is a
measure of the spread or scatter in data. Likewise, the variability or spread in the
values of a random variable may be measured by variance.

Also, the binominal expansion of ( q + p)3 is
qq p q p p332323+++
Note that the probabilities of 0, 1, 2 or 3 successes are respectively the 1st, 2nd,
3rd and 4th term in the expansion of ( q + p)3.
Also, since q + p = 1, it follows that the sum of these probabilities, as expected, is 1.
Thus, we may conclude that in an experiment of n-Bernoulli trials, the probabilities
of 0, 1, 2,..., n successes can be obtained as 1st, 2nd,...,( n + 1)th terms in the expansion
of (q + p)n. To  prove this assertion (result), let us find the probability of x-successes in
an experiment of n-Bernoulli trials.
Clearly, in case of x successes (S), there will be ( n – x) failures (F).
Now, x successes (S) and ( n – x) failures (F) can be obtained in !

In each of these ways, the probability of x successes and ( n − x) failures is
=P (x successes) . P( n–x) failures is

expansion of ( q + p)n.
Thus, the probability distribution of number of successes in an experiment consisting
of n Bernoulli trials may be obtained by the binomial expansion of ( q + p)n. Hence, this
