the variables x and y are different, however their means are slame. it is also
easily observable from the diagramatic representation of these distribbutions (fig 13.5).

to distinguish x from y, we require a measure of the extent to which the values of
the random variables spread out. in statistics, we have studied that the variance is a
n
measure of the spread or scatter in data. likewise, the variability or spread in the
o
values of a random variable may be measured by variance.
